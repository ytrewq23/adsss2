There are three data structures - MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap that have implementations of MyArrayList and MyLinkedList in Java.I used functionalities of ArrayList and LinkedList. I built logical data structures such as stacks, queues, and min-heaps based on these functionalities of ArrayList and LinkedList. 
MyArrayList - provides dynamic array-based storage.
MyLinkedList - implements a doubly linked list structure.
MyStack - implements the stack data structure based on  MyArrayList.Supports standard stack operations: push, pop, top, isEmpty, and clear.
MyQueue - also based on MyArrayList.Supports standard queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, and clear.
MyMinHeap -implements the min-heap data structure using MyArrayList.Supports insertion, extraction of minimum element, and maintaining the min-heap property,find left,rigth child
